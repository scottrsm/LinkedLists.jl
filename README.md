# LinkedLists.jl
A Julia idiomatic implementation of a (single) Linked List.
A number of Julia's features come to play in this implementation: 
using Type Stable methods, Multiple Dispatch, Parameterized Type Hierarchies, 
and Mutable and Immutable sub-types.

Interestingly, doing these things in a natural Julian way leads to high performance.
